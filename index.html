	Hello there!

	Come back later, and it might be different.

<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="section">

<p>
	My name is Amelia Oon, and I am a college student studying
	computer science and interactive media at Northeastern University.
	I enjoy web design and computers in general.
	Hopefully I'll end up with a cool web-dev job when I graduate.
</p>

<p>
	Other than web design and computers, I like spending time with friends
	and adventuring. I also like music, and playing the violin and piano.
	Recently I've developed an interest in film and video.
</p>

<p>
	My favorite color is purple, and I enjoy eating ice-cream.
</p>

<h1>About this site</h1>

<div class="section">

<p>
	This website will be a personal and professional website about who I am and the work I do.
	There may or may not be a blog, depending on whether or not I have time.
	In the future, you will be able to find a portfolio, resume and contact information on this site.
